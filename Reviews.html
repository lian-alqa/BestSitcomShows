        <p>What makes the big bang theory different from other shows is the fact that it has nerdy humor and geeky characters, and despite their social awakwardness you'd get to see how each of them had a huge character development </p>

    <h2>Gilmore girls</h2>
      <p> Gilmore gilrs is a heartwarming show that captures the essences of the mom and daughter relationship, and how they depend on each other to get over hurdles, and how each episode will showcase how genuine their relationship is and how they get to enjoy each other's company. </p>
